# FRIGHT-Food_done_right

### Created by the team Ï€-thon for the hackathon 
## People's 10 Code Combat 

### "This project is all about how we implement our ideas to reduce food wastage"

### About Project:

We used website to increase the awarenes to stop the food wastage and utilize the foods that are not being properly used instead of discarding them

Main page consists of a helpline number and our connect page to connect with us:

Next we have the awareness page to spread awareness

![Aware](https://github.com/manishgowdans2/FRIGHT-Food_Done_Right/blob/main/FRIGHT_MOBILE_APPLICATION/screenshot/web2.png)

And the hotels, party halls or any other companies can register with us to use our desktpop application so that they can properly utilize their products without wasting any of them

Now we use desktop application where the specified user can enter the given details which is user friendly

And then we get the output as follow

Once we recieve the pickup message

![Pickup](https://github.com/manishgowdans2/FRIGHT-Food_Done_Right/blob/main/FRIGHT_MOBILE_APPLICATION/screenshot/list.jpeg)

Through this way we intend to solve one of the major issues that are being faced that is "Food Wastage" in developedd cities where lots and lots of foods are being wasted without proper usage and we can connect them to the people who are really in need of these foods so that they don't have to go through sleppless nights without having anything to eat
